# A few words about the RSA

RSA encryption is one of the most popular encryption algorithms used to secure communications over the Internet. This asymmetric encryption algorithm was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, hence the name RSA.


The purpose of RSA encryption is to allow two parties to communicate securely over an insecure channel, such as the Internet, without the messages being intercepted or altered by malicious third parties. RSA uses a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, to encrypt and decrypt messages.


The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret by the recipient of the messages. To encrypt a message using RSA, the message is converted to digital form and then encrypted to a certain strength using the public key. The result of this operation is the encrypted message.


To decrypt the encrypted message, the recipient uses their private key, which is used to reverse the encryption process and restore the original message. The use of the RSA encryption algorithm thus ensures the confidentiality of communications and guarantees that only the recipient can read the messages sent.


RSA works because of the mathematical difficulty of factoring very large numbers into prime numbers. This difficulty makes it practically (almost) impossible for a third party to decrypt the messages without having access to the private key. The security of RSA is therefore based on the security of the private key and the difficulty of factoring very large numbers.
