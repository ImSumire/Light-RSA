# A few words about the Euler function

Euler's phi is an important mathematical function in number theory, also known as Euler's indicator function. It is denoted by φ(n). It gives the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are prime with n.


Formally, if n is a positive integer, then the Euler indicator function φ(n) is defined to return the number of positive integers m between 1 and n (inclusive) such that m and n are prime, that is, such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of m and n is one.


For example, if n = 8, the positive integers less than or equal to 8 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. So φ(8) is 4, and only 1, 3, 5 and 7 are prime with 8, since its PGCD with 8 is 1.


The Euler indicator function has many uses in mathematics, especially in number theory, cryptography and modular arithmetic. It plays an important role in some encryption algorithms, such as RSA. It is used to generate the public and private keys.
